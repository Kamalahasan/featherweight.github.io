The Featherweight Kernel is a library written in ANSI C89
that is called by many Featherweight G functions using the
`Call Library Function Node`.

The FTW Kernel exists in order to aggregate all libraries
that Featherweight uses and wraps as a single amalgamation
with a unified build and test process.
