The Featherweight brand, including logo, name, website, and concepts
documented, have been thoughtfully designed.

You are warmly welcomed to help build this brand by contributing
to the repositories, sharing information in presentations, and using
the library to build your own applications and business ventures.

There exist just a few considerations when advertising Featherweight:

## Logo Guidelines

This applies to sharing information that includes the Featherweight
Logo, including slideshow presentations and documents.

## Resumé and CV Guidelines

If you are a developer wanting to cite FTW experience or expertise
on your resumé, curriculum vitae, or other such personal branding
document, by all means, do so!

Though, prior to doing so, consider having substantial evidence of
public contributions as a basis.
